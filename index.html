    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Furkan AKCAN. I live in Turkey. I've been learning "Football
      Refereeing" for a long time. Also, I sometimes do podcast shows on
      spotify. Playing chess is a great passion for me.

    <p>
      I don't see learning software as a profession. Web developer is my passion
      for life. I want to be a student for life.
